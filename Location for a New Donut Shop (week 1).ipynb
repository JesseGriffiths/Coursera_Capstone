Here we'll determine the best location for an aspiring donut shop owner to open shop in Madison, WI. To do this we'll segment the city into distinct regions and examine the prevalence of different venue types in those regions. Then, we'll find a region that is similar to the region with the highest rate of donut shops/bakeries, but doesn't have a high rate itself.\n\nThe idea is that venues that do well in one region should also do well in a similar region. We then want to make sure that the donut shop is not in a region that already has many because we want to avoid competition as much as possible."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data\n\nWe'll be using Fourquare location data for Madison, WI. We'll use the coordinates of each location to calculate the geographic distances between clusters of venues, and segment the city into regions accordingly. For example, this is how we would differenciate between downtown and campus. Then, we'll examine venue types contained in each region to determine the similarity between regions. For example, two regions that have a lot of coffee shops and Indian restaurants would likely be more similar than a region that doesn't have either."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
